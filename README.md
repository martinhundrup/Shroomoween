Armed with his trusty acorn shotgun, help Shroomie escape a forest filled with ghosts, zombies, mummies, and more!

This was created as a self-imposed 'game jam' during Halloween 2024.

## Controls:
Space bar to jump, mouse to aim, and left mouse click to fire.

## Ammo:
Throughout the journey Shroomie can pick up acorns to use as ammo.

## Score:
As time goes on, Shroomie's score goes up, but the faster paced things become. Survive as long as you can!
